## Description

nodeExpressHandlebars is a repository that contains an application called Eat-Da-Burger that utilizes mySQL, Express, Handlebars, and a custom ORM to keep track of a list of burgers. The user can add names of burgers to the list and can toggle them between two categories: burgers to be eaten and burgers that have already been eaten.
